			<p>The Sri Lankan star tortoise is a small to medium-sized 
				tortoise native to the dry forests and scrublands of Sri Lanka. It is known 
				for its distinctively patterned carapace (shell), which features radiating 
				star-like patterns that vary in color from yellow to brown or black. They 
				primarily feed on vegetation and require warm, dry habitats with access to 
				sunlight for basking. Sri Lankan star tortoises are classified as vulnerable 
				due to habitat loss and illegal pet trade, making conservation efforts 
				crucial for their survival in the wild.</p>
